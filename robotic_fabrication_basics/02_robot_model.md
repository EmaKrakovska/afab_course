## Robot model (links and joints)
* Kinematic chain: links and joints (consists of frame and axis)

## Forward and inverse kinematics
* Forward kinemtics (show transformations of forward kin)
* Inverse Kinematics

## Workspace and calibration (end effector, work object)

* Robot reach
* Measuring in the end effector of a robot arm
* Measuring in the workobjects with the robot arm and a measurement tip

# AFAB Seminar

*Basics of Robotic Fabrication*

## Description

The Master-level course will introduce computational methods for architecture engineering, fabrication & construction, incentivising computational literacy. Students learn the theoretical background and basic implementation details of fundamental data structures and algorithms, and to solve real-world problems using the COMPAS and COMPAS_fab framework, and other open-source libraries.

## Learning objectives

* understand the scope and relevance of computational methods for architecture and engineering research and practice,
* the theoretical background of fundamental data structures, 
* the basic principles of algorithmic design; 
* implement basic versions of prevalent algorithms related to architectural geometry and robotic assembly; and
* use common CAD tools as interfaces to self-implemented solutions.

## Overview

This course will consist of a few lectures, several tutorials and project-based exercises.

The topics will include:

* Intro Python programming
* Intro COMPAS open-source framework (https://compas-dev.github.io/) 
* Intro to geometry processing, data structures, topology, numerical computation
* Domain-specific case studies (i.e., on architectural geometry, robotic assembly)

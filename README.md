# Teaching materials
This repository contains teaching material.

## Python Basics
* Variable, List, Dictionaries, Classes, Conditionals and Loops

## Rhino/Grasshopper Basics
* Simple Design Algorithms (?)

## Robot Basics
* Frame and Transformation
* Kinematics and Robot Model
* Process Control
* Basic Workflow (Workobject, Endeffector, e.g.)

## Robotic Fabrication Basics
* Assembly/Pick and Place
* Top down approach, e.g. brick wall
* Bottom up approach, e.g. growth algorithm


====================================================================
## Notebook Generative Design (optional)
* L-systems (text and drawing)
* shape grammars
* polygon subdivision
* cellular automata
* shortest path calculation
* dense polyomino packing
* biomorphs (genetic algorithms, after Dawkins' Blind Watchmaker)
* more evolutionary strategies (hill climbing, simulated annealing, â€¦)
* introduction to machine learning (iris classification, image classification with fashion MNIST
* more advanced ML: pix2pix image generation, variational auto-encoders with the quickdraw sketch dataset (remember the cats?), reinforcement learning for the inverted pendulum/cart pole

Notebook Generative Design:
	L-systems (text and drawing)
	shape grammars
	polygon subdivision
	cellular automata
	shortest path calculation
	dense polyomino packing
	biomorphs (genetic algorithms, after Dawkins' Blind Watchmaker)
	more evolutionary strategies (hill climbing, simulated annealing, …)
	introduction to machine learning (iris classification, image classification with fashion MNIST
	more advanced ML: pix2pix image generation, variational auto-encoders with the quickdraw sketch dataset (remember the cats?), reinforcement learning for the inverted pendulum/cart pole
